# Mini RSA challenge 
## **Flag**: picoCTF{e_sh0u1d_b3_lArg3r_6e2e6bda}

So this is the other Mini RSA challenge different from miniRSA, I actually first set out to do this because it was 'medium' level and the other was 'hard'. But I only solved it after I did that one, I thought the same logic and code would work for this but it didn't.
