# picoCTF C3

## **FLAG**: picoCTF(adlibs)

Since the encoder was given, I first inputted the ciphertext into the program, only to get a 'substring not found' error and realise what was written - this was the encoder not decoder, I tried dcodr.fr just in case it was a standard encryption but no results. Then, I thought of reversing the encoder to get the decoder since both lookup tables were available.

I then simply switched the lookup1 and lookup2 in the code:

```python
chars = "DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  out += lookup1[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

print(out)
```

but this upon passing the ciphertext simply threw more jumbled mess meaning I had not reversed it correct. 

```
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  out += lookup1[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur
```

what's happening here is a substitution of chars based on the difference between their current and previous indices in the lookup tables. So essentially the contents in lookup1 'lead' (stay ahead in their index number) lookup2 while being encoded and so should 'follow' lookup2 while being decoded

so the reversed output program would look something like this:

```python
chars = "DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  out += lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]
  prev = (cur+prev)%40

print(out)
```

now this was a mini-challenge in itself, kept running into logical errors, did some dry runs on a page and after some more effort, managed it

output:

```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo


chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```

well the hell, 
I wasn't gonna reverse another program if this was another encoder. So at first #fortychars made me think the input for it is ciphertext. 

'print chars[i] #prints'
error
' print(chars[i]) #prints and of course i modified the file input thing to just take input from chars="" '

Output: LgHDPt
tried that as flag, did not work

inputted this into the original decrpyter, =x(+ih 
did not work

there had to be something else to it
#asciiorder did not make sense
#pythontwo meant this was in python 2
#fortychars was kind of connected
#selfinput to what

the original program decoded the ciphertext, this program is #selfinput, so the input to this is not the ciphertext but the program itself? couldn't hurt to test

tested it in an online compiler by putting the program in chars"" with no space, got an output "adi i" maybe it needs to be inputted as it is, via a file, with some help from chatgpt (i'm not great with python syntax to input txt files) i got my program, ran it with the program as a txt file
and got adlibs. didn't make sense but ran it and it worked! finally! looked up and adlibs is something related to music?
